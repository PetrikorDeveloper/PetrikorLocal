There‚Äôs this very unusual disturbing silence, and it smells weird. I mean it really smells weird. You walk slowly to the source of that smell, and it takes you to the bedroom. You open the door to find your girlfriend caught red-handed in bed ... with a large extra cheesy pepperoni pizza next to a big bottle of coke. As you stand there in utter astonishment, you start recalling where did you go wrong to make this hideous thing happen. I think the blame is on the lack of your <strong>online presence</strong>.</p>

You have to stay present in people‚Äôs minds, and that doesn‚Äôt happen by making merely one campaign.</p>

Now I get all tensed up, sweaty, and nervous on how will I be able to call for an appointment. I can‚Äôt speak their language, they can‚Äôt speak mine, and somehow English doesn‚Äôt feel international anymore. I look up their website, and fortunately, they have a booking system.
